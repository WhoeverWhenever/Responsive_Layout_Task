Sorry, that I did this late, so I could not ask questions.
You will see the decisions I made, hope I got the task right.

I used SCSS to help me to style the document.
There .scss files for styling header, main content and footer.
ui.scss is used for additional classes:
ibg is used to fit almost every image in a block,
end-block is just a decorative class.

Media query for 361-769px range keeps the structure mentioned in task as "up to 1024px", 
but are used for better layout

Blocks 1-3 and 7 are done with flex.
Blocks 4-6 are done with grid.
